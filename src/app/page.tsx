            <li>
              Focused around building tech tools & solutions for the supply
              chain & purchasing teams.
            </li>
            <li>
              Currently have a live UK availability app running in real time
              that is used in 4 markets: UK, Sweden, Finland & Denmark that was
              developed by myself. It helps 250+ stores in these markets to
              monitor the product availability in each store. This web app is
              now vital in stores and is closely monitored by HQ. it&apos;s a
              web app that was built on react with typescript, using react fetch
              api.
            </li>

            <li>
              The UK Availability app is also used across other departments such
              as our facilities team & supply chain team. Facilities teams use
              the app to locate problems that occur in stores as you can see if
              grills, coffee machines or ice machines are down. Supply chain
              team uses it to monitor product availability across the whole
              market.
